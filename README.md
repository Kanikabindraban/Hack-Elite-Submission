Problem Statement: 

How can we enable a skilled worker to find a suitable job opportunity based on his skills, thereby increasing his average annual employment and reducing downtime at construction sites and subsequent loss of revenue.



Problem Description:

The construction industry's skilled worker base is highly unstructured and migratory.
A skilled worker relies on word of mouth to find a suitable job; often they are unemployed for long periods despite availability of jobs.
A construction site contractor looks for resources based on past jobs or employment agencies. 
There is no clear visibility of the upcoming jobs to the skilled worker and no visibility of resource availability to the site contractor. 
This results in longer wait time and sometimes, lost opportunities, cost leakage and loss of revenue.
It is important to bring skilled workers and contractors/customers together on the same platform so as to increase the efficiency in job and resource alignment.


How Can Technology Help:

Bringing the two searching entities together on the same platform. 
A place where skilled workers can search for ongoing projects so that they are never out of job
For customers, a common place to look for talent and rate the workers, hence reduce operational inefficiencies.

Introduction to App:
